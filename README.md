Bettr: Motivation-Boosting Task Manager
Bettr is a task management app that boosts motivation by incorporating monetary stakes and charitable donations for task completion. 
Built with Dart & Flutter during a hackathon (Jan 2024) with teammate Jason CK.

Miss the deadline? → The money is donated to charity.
Upload proof of work, and tasks can be verified by contacts.
